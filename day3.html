<meta name="description" content="I am a 20-year-old Learner. I want to share a story of mine, a dark phase of mine: I have been bullied a lot in my school days. I remember when I was in 8th grade. I wrote my first comic, it was so bad, that if I give it to you now to read, I guess you too might not laugh. Though I gave it to my friend Varun to read it, he made a few changes to it and it changed all its meaning. When I read it was better than earlier. He showed it to the whole class and they read it too. That was the time I did my first creative work. And with some changes, it gave me the friends I wished for. Just like my comic, I will never stop Improving and one day my charm will shine as bright as sun THAT NO ONE WILL, NO ONE CAN, IGNORE ME​. If one comic helps me to make so many friends, then what will happen if I learn everything that I like, and grab everything this world has to offer me.">
